### Tutorial1: ROS intermediate-level
complete codes template
- Exercise 1: Fix the CMakeList.txt of the template project
- Exercise 2: Create a node to compute the new turtle pose using a simple Kinematic Control.
- Exercise 3: Answer the following questions
- Exercise 4: Create node 2 to set the new desired pose of the turtle (x_d, y_d, theta_d) from a client to your defined service from node 1 .
- Exercise 5: Create Node 3 that receives the new computed pose of the turtle from Node 1 and visualize the turtle with its new pose.
- Exercise 5: Make your system modular, i.e. use a common object class for the subscriber (Node 3) and the client (Node 2) callback functions, i.e. Look at the file: turtle_vis/src/solutions/myClass
